        <h1>Flyers Bring Up Joel Farabee</h1>
        <p>After being part of the last round of cuts during training camp, Joel Farabee went back down to the AHL determined to prove that
        it was the wrong decision to send him down. He did exactly as he had 7 points during seven games. It was that performance that convinced
        upper manegment that he was ready to make an impact at the NHL level.

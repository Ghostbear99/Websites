        <h1>Inception</h1>
        <p>
            When the NHL announced that they were expanding to 16 teams in 1964, then Eagles 
            Vice President Ed Snider decided to try and bring hockey to Philadelphia. The bid from 
            Philadelphia was eventually picked over the bid from Baltimore. In order to fil out a team
            the expansion teams picked their players through a process called an expansion draft. One notable
            player that the Flyers picked in the 1967 expansion draft is Bernie Parent, which is one of the
            best goalies in Philadelphia Flyers history. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Flyers may have made the playoffs in their first year in the league, but they also had a
            sub .500 record during the regular season. During they playoffs there were upset by the St. Louis
            Blues. The Flyers would repeat this during their sophmore season. After two lackluster seasons and being beat
            by the St. Louis Blues both years, upper management vowed that their team would be tougher to beat.
            The 1969 NHL Amateur Draft was huge for the Philadelphia Flyers as they drafted both Bobby Clarke and Dave
            Shultz, two players that had a big impact in their future Stanley Cup wins.
        </p>
        <h1>Broad Street Bullies</h1>
        <p>
            After being medicore during their first few years of the draft the Flyers started becoming
            the famed Broad Street Bullies during the 1972-73 season. This was the year in which they got 
            their first playoff round win, but that is where their journey ended as they were bounced out by 
            the Montreal Canadians. The Philadelphia Flyers upward trajecotry continued during the 1973-74 season.
            During that season the Flyers won their division with a record of 50-16-12 and they entered the playoffs
            as one of the top teams in the league. The Flyers won the first two rounds and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals.
            But the Flyers had a tough opponent in the upcoming Stanley Cup finals, they had to face the Boston Bruins.
            It was a tough series but in the end the Flyers pervailed as they won their first Stanley Cup in game 7.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Flyers improved in the season after their Stanley Cup win as they had the best record in the league for the 
            1974-75 season. They were once again a juggernaut as they entered the 1975 playoffs. In the first round of the playoffs
            the Flyers faced the New York Islanders. The Flyers won the first three games of the series and it looked that they would 
            sweep the Islanders, but the Islanders fought back and won the next three games. It all came down to game 7 but the Flyers ended
            winning that game handidly with a score of 4-1. The Flyers went to the Stanley Cup Finals and faced the Buffalo Sabres. Out of this series
            came 'The Fog Game'in which most of the game was played in heavy fog, this was due to the lack of an air conditioning in Buffalo's Arena.
            The Flyers ended up winning their second Stanley Cup in 5 games.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most memorable moments of the 1975-76 season was when the Flyers played the Soviet Union. One of the reasons this game was 
            memorable is because halfway during the game the Soviet Union and threatened to leave beacuse they could not stand the Flyers rugged, physical
            style of play. The only reason the Soviet Union came back on the ice was becasuse Phialdelphia Fleyrs owner Ed Snider threatened to not 
            pay them if they left. The Flyers ended up winning that game convincly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Flyers went to a third straight Stanley Cup Finals appearance durring the 1975-76 season but Bernie Parent was injured and they lost against 
            the Montreal Canadaians. During the 1979-80 season the Philadelphia Flyers went undefeated for 35 straight games, which is a North American
            professional sports record which still stands to this day. The Flyers ended up going to the Stanley Cup Finals during this season but they ended up
            running into the New York Islanders and lost in 6 games.
        </p>
        <h1>A New Era Begins</h1>
        <p>
            As the last of the Broad Stree Bullies guard moved on a new era rose from the ashes. Some of these new era players include Brian Propp, Tim Kerr, Dave Poulin,
            Pelle Lindbergh, and Mark Howe. The new era did not begin with Stanley Cup Finals appearances but it instead began with three first round exits in a row. It 
            was during the 1984-85 season that the Flyers won a franchise record 53 games. They Flyers ended up returning to the Stanley Cup Finals this year but they ended up
            running into the defending Stanley Cup champions, Edmenton Oilers and lost in in 5 games. The beginning of the 1985-86 season did not start off well as the Flyers future 
            start goaltender, Pelle Lindbergh, died while driving drunk. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Flyers luckily had another star goaltender in their system and made his appearance in the 1986 season. That young goaltender's name was Ron Hextall who is known for his
            fights and the goal that he scored during hte 1986-1987 season. That season the Phialdelphia Flyers once again made a Stanley Cup finals appearance and once again ran into the 
            Edmenton Oilers. The injury riddled Flyers were able to extend the series to 7 games, but they ended up losing that game. This was the start of a slow decline for the Philadelphia Flyers.
        </p>
        <h1>A Young Star Rises</h1>
        <p>
            In order to try and rebuild and get back to their winning ways the Piladlephia Flyers traded for Ron Brind'Amour
            and Mark Recchi. During the 1991 NHL Draft the Quebec Nordiques picked Eric Lindros first overall but he refused to 
            play for them. This led them to field calls from other teams about the young phenom. Both the Flyers and Rangers put in trade
            offers and Quebec made deals with both teams. This had to go to abbritration and it was found that Quebec made the deal with 
            Philadelphia first and thus they were awarded Eric Lindros. There was a high price from acqiring Lindros as they had to 
            give up Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, and two first round picks.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his first season Eric Lindros scored 41 goals and proved that he was indeed that player that he was advertised to be. 
            The Flyers missed the playoffs in their next two season and because of this Ed Snider fired then general manager Farwell 
            and courted Bobby Clarke to be the next general manager. He immediately put his stamp on the team as during the 1994-95 
            season he acquired Ron Hexall and traded Mark Recchi for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne, and John LeClair. This was the year
            that they returned to the playoffs and made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals but they were upset by the 
            New Jersey Devils, who won the Stanley Cup that year.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 1996-96 season Eric Lindros put up 115 points and helped propel the Flyers to the top of their division and the top
            seed in the East. In the first round the Philadelphia Flyers dispatched the eight seed Tampa Bay Lightning in 6 games. But a promising
            season ended when the Florida Panthers dispatched them in six games.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the 1996-97 season Eric Lindros missed the first 30 games, but they still had a lot of star power and 
            were able to do pretty well without him. Bobby Clarke acquired Paul Coffey during the season to help bolster their defense. 
            They almost finished on top of thier division once again, but they were one point short of that. The Flyers were a force to be 
            reckoned with and they proved that during the playoffs. They dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins, Buffalo Sabres, and New York 
            Rangers in five games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. They fell very short of their goal of winning the Stanley Cup as
            they were swept by the Detroit Red Wings.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next two seasons the Flyers were eliminated in the first round. But one of the biggest events happened during the 1998-99 season.
            During that season Eric Lindros was having an MVP type season but that all came to an end when he had a collapsed lung. This along with 
            several other concussions during the ensuing year worsened the relationship between Lindros and upper management. After sucumbing to the 
            Devils in the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals, Eric Lindros sat out the next season and demanded to be traded. He was eventuall traded to 
            the New York Rangers.
        </p>
        <h1>Early 2000s</h1>
        <p>
            In 2001 The Flyers reshaped their roster. During free agency they sign Jeremy Roenick and acquired Kin Johnson, Jav Hlavac and Paval Brendl
            in the Eric Lindros trade. The Flyers started off that season pretty strong and ended on top of the division at the end of the season. But during 
            the playoffs they could not muster much offense and were taking out in five games by the Ottawa Senators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next season they were once again one of the top teams in the league and they were able to make it past the first round. In the secon round they
            faced the Ottawa Senators. They matched up much better with them then the year before and it took 6 games before the Flyers were once agian eliminated 
            from the playoffs. After this playoff round loss the Flyers traded their star goaltender Roman Cechmanek.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 2003-04 season the Flyers suffered injuries to key player like Primeau and Roenick. Because of this the Flyers had to acquire some players 
            that allowed them to stay afloat during the season. But when it was all said and done the Flyers won the division and entered the playoffs as a force to
            be reckoned with. The Flyers were able to get through the first two rounds and advnace to the Eastern Conference Finals where they face the young Tampa
            Bay Lightning. The Flyers and Lightning played a tough series and it went back and forth but in the end the Flyers lost in game 7 by a score of 2-1. This
            was the last season where the Flyers had Recchi, Roenick, and LeClair. In order to replace them the Flyers signed Peter Forseberg in free agency and brought 
            up some young players from their AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Flyers entered the 2005-06 season with high expectations and for the most part they lived up to those expectations.
            Even though during the season an injury to Forseberg hampered the team and they fell in the standings a little bit. Depsite
            that, they finished thrid in the NHL at the end of the season. The regular season success would not follow into the playoffs 
            as they fell agains the Buffalo Sabres in the first round. For the 2006-07 season the Flyers went from a playoff team to the
            worst team in the league. Even though they were the worst they came second in the draft lottery and barely missed out on a young
            phenom called Patrick Kane. They drafted James Van Reimsdyk second overall. General Manager Paul Holmgren sought to drastically 
            overhaul the team that offseason. The Flyers traded Peter Forseberg for Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent. They also shipped defensman 
            Alexi Zhitnik to the Atlanta Thrahers for Braydon Coburn. They also acquired Lasse Kukkonen and Martin Biron. They also traded for 
            Kimmo Timonen and Scott Hartnell and signed them both for 6 years. They also signed Danny Briere during free agency. They continued
            rebuilding the team as they traded Joni Pitkaned and Geoff Sanderson in exchange for Jason Smith and Joffrey Lupul. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Richard and Carter Era</h1>
        <p>
            During the beginning of the 2007-08 season the Flyers started out hot and were towards the top of their division after January. 
            The Flyers did stumble in the middle of February as they went on a 10 game losing streak. They managed to quickly rebound and entered
            the playoffs as the 6th seed. The Flyers got past the Washington Capitals in 7 games in the first round and easily got past the 
            Montreal Canadaians in five games. This led to an Eastern Conference Finals against their interstate rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins.
            The Flyers had injuries to key defensman as they entered the series and this hampered the Flyers as they lost to the Penguins in 5 games.
            It was overall a successfull season for the Flyers and a vast improvement from the year before. The Mike Richards era began as at the beginning
            of the 2008-09 season he was named the captain of the team. The Flyers as a whole were an inconsistent team but rookies Claude Giroux and 
            Lucas Sbisa played pretty well and were pleasant surpries for the team. The Flyers entered the playoffs as the fifth seed and faced the Penguins
            in the first round. Even though this series was much closer than the year before, they lost to the Penguins in 6 games.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to try and help solidify the defense, general manager Paul Holmgren signed Chris Pronger. They also signed goaltenders
            Ray Emery and Brian Boucher. The Flyers did not get off to a good start and is what got head coach Jonh Stevens replaced by Peter
            Laviolette. This change behind the net is what helped propel the Flyers to slip into the playoffs as the 7th seed. In the first round they 
            upset the New Jersey Devils in 5 games and went to face the Boston Bruins in the second round. The beginning of this series did not go well for the 
            Flyers as they went down 3-0 in the series. The Flyers were able to rally together and win the next three games, which set up a game 7 in Boston. Early in the
            game the Bruins looked to bury the dagger and got off to a 3-0 lead before the halfway mark of the first period. Peter Laviolette helped calm his troops
            and the Flyers dominated the rest of the game as they came back and won the game 4-3 to win the series 4-3. The Philadelphia Flyers became the 3rd team
            in league history in order to accomplish this feat. After that second round series the Philadelphia Flyers rode high on that emotional wave and dominated the 
            Montreal Canadians as they easily got past them in five games to head to the Stanley Cup Final. Many believed that this was the year in which the Flyers were 
            meant to win the Stanley Cup again, but they had to do it against the Chicago Blackhawks. This series was a very high scoring affair and it went back and forth. But 
            the Flyers were defeated in six games. This year was the last bit of success that the Flyers have had in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
            After almost winning the Stanley Cup, the Philadlephia Flyers looked to teak things as they looked to win the Stanley Cup. They traded Simon Gagne to the Tampa
            Bay Lightning for defensman Andrej Meszaros and also acquired Sean O'Donnell in a seperate trade. They also gave the reigns of the starting goalie position to 
            rookie Sergei Bobrovsky. The Flyers were one of the top teams in the league and were the best team in the league for the majority of the season. But after they acquired
            Kris Versteeg at the trade deadline, the Flyers tetered and fell in the standings as they finished as the top team in the division. The Flyers lackluster play continues as 
            they barely got past the Buffalo Sabres in the first round. They were not able to get past the Boston Bruins in the second round as they were swept. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Claude Giroux Era</h1>
        <p>
            After a disspointing season the Flyers looked to shake things up. They did so when they traded both Jeff Carter and Mike Richards. In return from these trades the Flyers
            recieved Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and Jakub Voracek. With the picks they recieved in the tade the Flyers selected Sean Couturier and Nick Cousins. The Flyers also looked 
            to improve their goaltending as they signed Illya Bryzgalov to a monster nine year contract. They also addressed their depth scoring as they signed Max Talbot, Andreas Lilja, and 
            Jaromir Jagr. The Flyers also brought up some rookies throughout the season and one of those rookies was named Matt Read. Early on he was an electrifying goal scorer. The Flyers finished
            top four in the league and drew the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round. This playoff series was the highlight of the season and one of the most fun playoff series in NHL history.
            The Flyers were able to get past the Penguins in six games but were emotionally wasted and could not get past the New Jersey Devils in the second round. 
        </p>
        <h1>Recent History to Present</h1>
        <p>
            In 2014 Peter Laviolette was fired when the Flyers got off to a slow start early on in the season and was replaced by Craig Berube. The Flyesr finished towards the top of the league but
            lost in 7 games to the New York Rangers in the first round. In the following year the Flyers announced that Paul Holmgren became President of the team and was replaced by Ron Hextall. Ron Hextall 
            shifted the team's philosophy from winning to rebuilding as the next several years saw near the bottom of the league finishes and first round exits. Some notable draft
            picks that he made were Joel Farbaee, Travis Konecny, Morgan Frost, Nolan Patrick, Ivan Provorov, Travis Sanheim, Robert Hagg, Carter Hart, German Rubstov, and Wade Allison. He also picked up
            some undrafted players who might prove to be valuable to the team in the future. Two of these signings are Philippe Myers and Yegor Zamula. In the middle of the 2018-19 season Flyers ownership felt
            that it was time to switch focus back to winning as they fired both general manager Ron Hextall and head coach Dave Hakstol. They were both eventually replaced by general manager Chuck Fletcher and 
            head coach Alain Vigneault. In the 2019 offseason the Flyers acquired Matt Niskanen and Ryan Braun in trades and signed Kevin Hayes. The 2019-20 season is still young but it looks like the Flyers could be 
            contenders for years to come.
